"""Following an appliance whose DHCP lease moved (issue #469).

Home Assistant's dhcp integration hands a discovery flow three fields --
address, hostname and MAC -- and only the MAC identifies a unit: three of
#469's air conditioners answer to one hostname. So these cover the two
halves that make the MAC usable: reading the one the appliance reports, and
what the flow does with a sighting of it.
